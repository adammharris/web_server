# Adam's Web Server

Hi, I'm Adam! This is my web server I wrote in Rust, partially based off of the tutorial in the Rust documentation.

## Why?

I made this project for mostly educational reasons:
- Learning the Rust programming language
- Solidifying my understanding of web servers, HTTP, etc.
- Refreshing my memory for JavaScript, HTML, CSS

But I also made it for another reason. One day, I would like to have a website of my own, which would essentially be a blog but with password-protected portions that only specific people can see.

I already have a private journal composed of Markdown files in a folder. I want to share them, but in an intelligent way. This project will help me understand how that could be possible.

## What should I do?

If you want to make a change, go ahead! I don't bite!

However, this project isn't currently well-documented. I apologize for that!
